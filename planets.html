    <h1>Planets in our Solar System</h1>
    <hr>
    <!--Introduction-->
    <p><b>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.
        The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestial planets,gaint planets(ice gaints and gas gaints).</p>
    <p>The terrestial planets named Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars have a definite surface and are mostly made of rock and metal.
        The gas gaints named Jupiter and Saturn are mostly made of hydrogen and helium, while the ice gaints named Uranus and Neptune 
        are mostly made of volatile substances such as water,ammonia and methane.</b></p>
    <h3><i>List of Planets:</i></h3>
    <ol type="i">
        <b>
        <li>Mercury</li>
        <li>Venus</li>
        <li>Earth</li>

        </b>
    </ol>
    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System.
        It has a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere.
        It is the fastest and coldest planet with rough surface.</p>
    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all rocky bodies 
        in the Solar System, and only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth.
        It spins in the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. 
        It also has a very slow rotation making its day longer than its year.</p>
    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>Our home planet, Earth, is the only world in our Solar System with liquid water on the surface. 
        It is also called as the Blue Planet, Gaia, Terra. It has a diverse range of ecosystems and a breathable 
        atmosphere that makes it unique among the planets. The Earth's biodiversity has evolved over hundreds of million years, 
        expanding continually except when punctuated by mass extinctions.</p>
    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet and its radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System. Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky.
        It is also called as "Red Planet" because of its iron materials. Its atmosphere mainly consists of carbondioxide and some water vapour. Mars is 
        approximately half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land.</p>
    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the 
        other planets in the Solar System combined. It is the planet with 80 moons and Faint rings made of dust,not ice. 
        Jupiter rotates around the sun once each 12 years. Despite its sheer size, Jupiter rotates on its axis pretty fast 
        (in 9hrs and 19 min). Jupiter is made up of gas and liquid, and has no solid.</p>
    <h2>Saturn</h2>
    <p>Saturn is the second largest planet after Jupiter with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.
        It is a planet adorned with thousands of beautiful Ringlets, and made of chunks of ice, rock and hydrogen, helium gases.
        Saturn occupies almost 60 percent of Jupiter's volume but has only about one-third of its mass and the lowest mean 
        density about 70 percent that of water of any known object in the solar system.</p>
    <h2>Uranus</h2>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. 
        Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both are of different chemical composition to the larger gas gaints Jupiter and Saturn. 
        It is mostly made of flowing icy materials above a solid core.</p>
    <h2>Neptune</h2>
    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass.
         Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth
        and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth but not as dense.</p>
